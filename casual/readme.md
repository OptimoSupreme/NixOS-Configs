This configuration is a template configuration designed for the casual PC user. It adds `gnome-software`, `flatpak`, and configures `flathub` to allow for imperative software installations like they might be used to. It also updates itself and cleans up old generations.

Because this template is for a non specific use case, you will need to change options such as for a bios legacy boot system, users, etc.
